Next-Generation Userinterface (NGUI) for automotives
====================================================

With this project you can remove the A pillar from your car and get an improved overview of the enviroment.
We achieve this goal by adding led strips to the a pillars which visualize the distance to any objects outside of the car. So we improve the safety on the streets.

You can find the main documentation and the progress of this project on [our blog](http://nextgenuiautomotive.wordpress.com).
